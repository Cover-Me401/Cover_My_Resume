Duties will be broken up approximately as follows:</p>\n <p></p>\n <ul> \n  <li> System development (45%)—Develop environmental data management systems for a variety of projects focusing on cloud-based architecture, online data entry, real-time data acquisition, and online data visualization</li> \n  <li>Data analysis (45%)—Assist scientific research teams with data mining and analytics</li> \n  <li>Existing systems maintenance (10%)—Maintain existing data management systems and web applications including bug fixes, new feature development, and performance tuning</li>\n </ul>\n <br> \n <p></p> \n <p><i> Must Haves</i></p> \n <ul> \n  <li>EITHER a bachelor’s degree in environmental science, environmental engineering, or a related discipline and a web programming boot camp type course OR a bachelor’s degree in computer science, informatics, or related discipline</li> \n  <li>Proficiency in Python programming language and SQL</li> \n  <li>Training in web development and data visualization using JavaScript</li> \n  <li>Strong interest in environmental science and/or natural resource management</li> \n  <li>Strong communication and problem-solving skills</li> \n </ul> \n <p><i>Nice to Haves</i></p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Experience with Pandas data manipulation library and Django web development framework</li> \n  <li>Experience working with spatial data and web mapping</li> \n  <li>Experience with Amazon Web Services</li> \n  <li>Experience with environmental, natural resource, and/or wildlife data management and analysis</li>\n </ul>\n <br> \n <p></p> \n <p><b> Our Story</b></p> \n <p> The Four Peaks Environmental Science &amp; Data Solutions, LLC (Four Peaks) is an environmental science and engineering firm helping solve environmental challenges in our rivers, lakes, and oceans.

Our projects have included work on salmon recovery and Clean Water Act compliance, and we take pride in the positive impact our projects have on our communities. The Four Peaks Data Solutions team builds the technological scaffolding that supports our environmental research. Specifically, our projects involve developing data management and analytics systems that transform environmental data into readily accessible information to support environmental management decisions.</p>\n <p></p>\n <p><br> Our firm is committed to ensuring a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community.

This tool is a key part of our plan to improve the world’s ability to deliver data-heavy nuclear power construction projects on time and budget. It contains a nuclear reactor project-specific data model linking the plant safety functions, requirements, scientific analyses, documentation, tests, and more. It acts as a single source of truth across the project to help coordinate design and construction efforts. It facilitates workflows that satisfy project procedures. This role will work closely with engineering management, QA, and the internal user base to continue to build and refine the tool’s capabilities, improve the quality pedigree, monitor and improve performance as needed, and to fix bugs as they are identified. The tool is a Python/Django/DRF backend running on Linux servers with a JavaScript/Vue3/Quasar frontend SPA user interface. The developer team is relatively small: only ~5 people. We’re looking for someone who takes pride in the craft of software development, is willing to learn and understand our somewhat obscure use case, and is highly focused and self-motivated. Responsibilities: Design, implement, document, and test software based on formally defined requirements and bug reports from the in-house user base Design and implement refactorizations and maintenance to maximize near- and long-term productivity of users and developers Identify and prioritize tasks without them being explicitly assigned to you Support verification and validation efforts to prove that the codes meet specifications and are correct Systematically identify performance or productivity bottlenecks; design and implement solutions to eliminate them Perform administrative data management operations on the backend based on user and management needs Understand and translate new feature requests into formal software requirements Train and support reactor designers to use the software system Provide mentoring to other developers Support software build and testing systems (like our Jenkins instance and related dashboards) Support server configuration and maintenance needs Facilitate design reviews for ongoing developments to keep review/approval process as productive as possible Review proposed code changes and provide detailed feedback before allowing it to go live Ensure compliance with quality standards and regulatory requirements Minimum Qualifications: 5+ years of relevant experience on web application development Strong programming skills in Python and JavaScript Strong and in-depth expertise in Django Strong expertise in some JavaScript framework like Vue3 Expert capabilities with software development tools, including git, IDEs, profilers, debuggers, test frameworks, packaging tools Ability to focus and comfort with delivering a challenging project under evolving conditions, during rapid-paced development Ability and professionalism to work within the robust regulatory environment of nuclear reactor design and construction A strong commitment to software best practices, Good understanding of software quality assurance and the software development life cycle Ability to provide and receive professional feedback Preferred Qualifications: Degree in computer science, applied mathematics, or similar Expertise building and maintaining Linux application and database servers In-depth expertise with Django REST Framework Expertise in configuring and maintaining Continuous Integration systems Strong expertise in Vue3 and Quasar Experience with major industrial construction projects Experience working in NQA-1 environments Excellent written and verbal communication skills Pay rate range is expected to be $60/hour - $100/hour.
